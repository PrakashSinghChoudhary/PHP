**Constants**

Constants are values that cannot change once they are defined, unlike variables, where values can be changed after they are defined.
* Name of constants follows the same rule as variable
* Name of constants are case sensitive
* Convention is to use upper case 
* Constants are not prefixed with `$` like they are in variables  

```php
<?php

  define("STATUS_PAID", "paid");  
  echo STATUS_PAID;

?>
```

<br/><br/>

Check if a constant has been defined

```php
<?php

  defined("STATUS_PAID"); // true

?>
```

<br/><br/>

Another way to define constants
* Constants defined using `const` keyword are defined at compile time while constants created using `define` keyword are defined at runtime
* So constants created using `const` cannot be created inside control structures, like loops or if-else

```php
<?php

  const STATUS_PAID = "paid";
  echo STATUS_PAID;

?>
```

<br/><br/>

Dynamically define constant names

```php
<?php

  $paid = "PAID";
  define("STATUS_" . $paid, $paid);
  echo STATUS_PAID;  // PAID

?>
```

Some examples of predefined constants and magic constants  
Magic constants are called so because their value can change depending on the context

```php
<?php

  echo PHP_VERSION;  // Prints current PHP version
  
  echo __LINE__;  // Prints current line 
  echo __FILE__;  // Prints absolute file path

?>
```

<br/><br/>

**Variables**

Variable variables takes the name of the value and treats that as the new variable

```php
<?php

  $foo = "bar";
  $$foo = "baz";  // i.e. $$foo equals $bar

  echo $foo;  // bar
  echo $bar;  // baz
  echo "$foo ${$foo}"  // barbaz
    
?>
```
