**Constants**

Constants are values that cannot change once they are defined, unlike variables, where values can be changed after they are defined.
* Name of constants follows the same rule as variable
* Name of constants are case sensitive
* Convention is to use upper case 
* Constants are not prefixed with `$` like they are in variables  

```php
<?php

  define("STATUS_PAID", "paid");  
  echo STATUS_PAID;

?>
```

Check if a constant has been defined

```php
<?php

  defined("STATUS_PAID"); // true

?>
```
Another way to define constants
* Constants defined using `const` keyword are defined at compile time while constants created using `define` keyword are defined at runtime
* So constants created using `const` cannot be created inside control structures, like loops or if-else

```php
<?php

  const STATUS_PAID = "paid";
  echo STATUS_PAID;

?>
```
