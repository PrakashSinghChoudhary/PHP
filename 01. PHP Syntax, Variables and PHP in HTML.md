The opening and closing tag for php is:

```php
<?php

  // ...code

?>
```

If the file entirely contains php code then the closing tag is redundant. 
Not only that it is redundant but also that there is a possibility of unwanted newline or white space appearing after the closing tag.  
  
----
When the file contains both `PHP` and `HTML` code, then closing tag is necessary.

```php

$total = getTotal();

<h1>Hello, John</h1>
<p>Your total is: <?php echo $total; ?></p>
<button>Process to Pay</button>

```  

----

Display text on the screen

```php
<?php

  echo "Hello World";
  print "Hello World";

  echo("Hello World");
  print("Hello World");

?>
```
`echo` and `print` are slightly different, for example, `print` has a return value of 1 and `echo` is marginally faster than print.  
  
----

Variables

They must start with letter or a underscore(`_`)
The first letter of variable cannot be a number
```php
<?php

  $greetings = "Hello";
  $_testResult = 97;

?>
```  

----

Variable are `pass by value` and not `pass by reference` but a variable can be assigned by reference by using `&`
```php
<?php

  $x = 1;
  $y = $x;  // Pass by value

  $x = 3;
  echo $y; // 1 and not 3

  $x = 1;
  $y = &$x; // Pass by reference

  $x = 3;
  echo $y; // 3


?>
```  

----

Display variables inside `echo`  
Note: Always use double quotes `""` for displaying variables and not single quotes `''` as single quotes dont process variables and prints it as is.

```php
<?php

  $name = "John";
  echo "Hello $name"; // Hello John
  echo "Hello {$name}";
  echo "Hello " . $name;

?>
```
